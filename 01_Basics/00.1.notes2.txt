1) Months in js start with 0(0 indexed)

2)** To convert miliseconds to seconds  --> divide miliseconds/1000 and then math.floor
or math.round

3) slice runs before  range(if upper bound is 3,it goes till 2) ; Splice goes till range(if range is 3 , it goes till 3)
Excepton --> if the lower bound  of both slice and splice  is 0,the answer will be same. Ex- (0,3) in both will return
same answer

4) slice does not change the original array, Splice does

5) Object can 2 declared in 2 types :- 1.Through Literals 2.Through Constructor

6)Literals :- Objects created using object literals are singletons. This means when a 
change is made to the object, it affects that object across the entire script.

7)Object defined with a function constructor let us have multiple instances of that
 object. This means change made to one instance, will not affect other instances.
