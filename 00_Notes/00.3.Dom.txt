The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(HyperText
 Markup Language) and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. It defines the
 logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

 DOM is a way to represent the webpage in a structured hierarchical way so that it
 will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document. With DOM,
 we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes, or Elements 
 of HTML using commands or methods provided by the Document object.

 2)Why is DOM required??
 
 When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the javascript can not understand the
  HTML document directly. So, a corresponding document is created(DOM). DOM is 
  basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format
   with the use of objects. Javascript interprets DOM easily i.e javascript 
   can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>) in HTML document but can understand 
   object h1 in DOM. Now, Javascript can access each of the objects 
   (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.
