1) What is a prototype?

In JavaScript, objects can inherit features from one another via prototypes. Every 
object has its own property called prototype.Its is a special hidden property.

Because a prototype itself is also another object, the prototype has its own prototype.
 This creates a something called prototype chain. The prototype chain ends when a 
 prototype has null for its own prototype.

[[Prototype]] is a special hidden property in JavaScript objects, but because it
 cannot be directly accessed, it can be accessed through the __proto__ access method.

2) what is prototypal inheritance?

Every type of datatype in javascript like arrays,functions etc. eventually inherits
 it's  prototype features from an object.This creates the prototypal chain and This
 chain continues till the prototype has null for its own prototype.This is called prototypal
 inheritance and why "everything in javascript is an object".
