1) Difference between InnerText,TextContent and InnerHtml in browser tools  -->
InnerText displays all the text that is visible on that selected region of then website.
TextContent displays all the text at the selected region, even the text hidden with the
help of css.
InnerHtml returns all the html along with the text of that selected region.

4) queryselector retuns the first occurence of the selected query. Classes are called
by (.) and id are called by (#)

5) queryselectorall  returns all the occurences of the requested query in the form
 of a nodelist.

6) A Nodelist is very similar to an array, except an array has much more prototype features
than a Nodelist.

7) An HTML Collection is similar to a Nodelist but with even less features including lack of 
foreach loop

8) Nodelists and HTML Collections are converted to arrays using method
Array.from(Nodelist/HTML Collection stored in a variable)
