Does javascript have classes?

Classes were introduced in EcmaScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a cleaner way to 
 follow object-oriented programming patterns.The introduction of classes in JS 
 made it easier for developers to build software around OOP concepts. It also
  brought in similarities to different OOP-based programming languages such as
   C++ and Java.

 But in reality,JavaScript still follows a prototype-based 
   inheritance model. Classes in JavaScript are syntactic sugar over the 
   prototype-based inheritance model which we use to implement OOP concepts. 

So even though javascript has classes, it actually runs differently than
   other class based languages with class based inheritance, as it has a
   prototype based nature under the hood.
