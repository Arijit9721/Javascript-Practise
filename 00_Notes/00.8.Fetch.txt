Fetch--> It is a global method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources 
asynchronously across the network.The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request 
data from a server. The request can be of any type of API that returns the data in 
JSON or XML. The fetch() method requires one parameter, the URL to request, and returns
 a promise.

2) When a fetch method is executed, it returns a promise. So it is always recorded 
in the microtask queue.

3)** Inner Workings of Fetch method --> when the fetch method is called, it executes
2 jobs -> Firstly,it creates an empty memory block and  2 empty arrays(onFulfilled[]
and onRejection[]). Secondly, it calls upon the Web/Node API and sends a network request
for  receiving the information.

Once the request returns a response,whether resolve or reject, it gets stored either
at onFulfilled[] or onRejection[] array. These arrays have a  inbuilt function which
allows them to store this response in the empty memory bock and then the memory block
is stored in the global memory and it bbecomes the final response.

4) onFulfilled[],onRejection[] and the empty memory block all work behind the scenes
and so they cannot be accessed by the user.
